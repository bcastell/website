**Welcome,**

My name is Brandon Castellanos. I am a software engineer from the University of Southern California. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in Spring 2017. Throughout my university years, I interned at Northrop Grumman and Qualcomm in the summers of 2015 and 2016, respectively.

I am working on building this website from the bottom up to showcase my talents, share my experiences, and teach others what I have learned.

This is some sample text to flood the homepage with plenty of content so get ready to take it all in at once.

Allright well here goes nothing.

Actually, let me take care of something first before I begin.

This is something that I must finish and cannot be postponed.

Otherwise bad things will happen.

Like really really bad things.

Okay I am almost done and will let you know.

Almost there...

I think I am done.

Hmm...

Everything seems to be in its right place.

Lets begin shall we?

Now hopefully that was not too much text.

Take a look at this website and thanks for visiting.

Cheers,

Brandon Castellanos
