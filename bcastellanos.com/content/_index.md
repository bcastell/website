					My name is Brandon Castellanos. I'm a software engineer with a B.S. in
                    Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California.

				<p>
					Few things get me as excited as creating simple solutions to complex problems.
					Philosophical talks with Uber drivers and eating Cheez-Its get pretty close.

				<p>
					Cheers,
